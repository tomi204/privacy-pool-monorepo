# Welcome to Lunarys

Lunarys is a privacy-first automated market maker that couples public USDC liquidity with ciphertext balances secured by fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). This documentation mirrors the monorepo structure and guides you through every layerâ€”from smart contracts and relayer flows to the React frontend and testing strategy.

Use the sidebar to jump directly to the topic you need:

- **Quickstart** for spinning up the local stack or deploying to Sepolia
- **Deployments** for the latest contract addresses
- **Architecture** sections for deep dives into contracts, frontend, and the relayer loop
- **Operations** for testing, troubleshooting, and day-two maintenance tips

If you are new to the project, continue with the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to get Lunarys running end-to-end in minutes.
